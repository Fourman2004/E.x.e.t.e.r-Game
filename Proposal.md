## Electronics and components

I will need one button, two potentiometers, at the very least three to five resistors, the arduino and a Printed Circuit Board.
For non-electronic parts, I will need one Glove (Latex or not, just as long as it doesn't conduct electricity to the body), and a 3D printed Box to house the Arduino and the Circuit Board.
Overall, the Elctronic components aren't expensive at all, as most will be in the electronic starter kit. I will however, need to buy a PCB or Prototyping Board, as to house the components.
---------------
## Game Design

The Game Will be A small room, in which it is an escape room. The player has 10 minutes to escape, or it's game over.
The game will feature very basic level design, and almost no art direction. For the code, I will need:

Doors (and keys)

Player Movement & interaction

Buttons

Timer

Gameplay Loop

---------------
## Controller design

The Controller will be glove with wires going from the fingers to a Box that will sit on the forearm or the wrist. the box is the housing Unit for the Components and Arduino.
The housing unit will be 3D printed and attached to the wrist with a band, either of plastic or rubber. The design of the Box will have a small platform to seperate the PCB/Protoype board from the Arduino, Along with section for the wires to come out of,along with one for the USB port on the arduino.
